## Overview

The `CookieHandler` component is responsible for managing cookies related to authentication. It retrieves the authentication state from the Redux store using the `useSelector` hook. Whenever the `auth` object changes, it updates the cookies for the access token and authentication status using the `js-cookie` library.
